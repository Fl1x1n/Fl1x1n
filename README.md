# **Fl1x1n/Fl1x1n**
### Introduction

Hello fella! I'm an IT student currently finishing my course. I don't really focus on only one thing, as my profile will probably be full of distinct projects (most of them will probably be unfinished). Right now I'm working on a small mobile meteorology app for android, made with jetpack compose in collaboration with [Redux](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes) (he basically made the entire [API](https://open-meteo.com/) service and view model. Thank you mateüôè).
My UI Designs are a 50/50, either half terrible or completely terrible.

(I know its disappointing, I'm sorryüò≠)

### In the works
- Nuage, Meteorology App (might change the name for something else);
- Last Rose of Summer (a site made as a school project, featuring some HTML functions and thingies. At first I thought I would only use it for school, but it turned out surprisingly good, so I'll keep it as a personal project);
- Personal Website (didn't start **yet**, but it'll be until the end of 2024... maybe).

### Learning
I‚Äôm currently learning unity basics, alongside C#. I'm also a self-taught guitarist (despite being terrible at it). 

### Help ?
-  I‚Äôm looking for help with basically everything. Unfortunately, I probably won't be able to go to university, so I'll try to expand my knowledge via **‚ú®The Internet‚ú®**. You can also contact me if you see anything in my code you think that could've been done in a more optimized way (Even the java one, although I won't be using it on the future).

### Contact
For now I'm not sure what socials I should use, so for now you can only use github to contact me. I'll be updating this section when possible.

### Other Things
I'm reallly lazy so basically everything I do won't be finished or rushed towards the end. I'm actively trying to lose that habit tho :) 
On my freetime I like to listen to music. Can't really call myself an audiophile because that just sounds strange to me. I'm into rock and heavy metal classics.
