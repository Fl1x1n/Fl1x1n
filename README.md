# **Fl1x1n/Fl1x1n**
### Introduction

Hi! I'm an IT student currently finishing my course. I don't really focus on only one thing, as my profile will probably be full of distinct projects (most of them will probably be unfinished). Right now I'm working on a small mobile meteorology app for android, made with jetpack compose in collaboration with [Redux](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes) (he basically made the entire [API](https://open-meteo.com/) service and view model. (Thanks mate).
My UI Designs are a 50/50, either half terrible or completely terrible.

### In the works
- Nuage, Meteorology App;
- Last Rose of Summer (a site made as a school project, featuring some HTML functions and thingies. At first I thought I would only use it for school, but it turned out surprisingly good, so I'll keep it as a personal project);
- Personal Website (work in progress).

### Learning
- Jetpack Compose & Kotlin
- UI/UX design
- HTML, CSS and JS


### Contact
For now, there's no way of contacting me effectevely. This is changing in the near future, so stay tuned for future updates 

### Other Things
This page will probably go through a Hiatus around the second half of July, without a specific come back date. My studies are ending around that time, and with that my only functional PC will have to be returned, leaving me without a computer. It's a future investment, but it might take some time until I bring any uptades to my projects.
