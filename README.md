# **Fl1x1n/Fl1x1n**
### Introduction

Hi! I'm an IT student currently finishing my course. I don't really focus on only one thing, as my profile will probably be full of distinct projects (most of them will probably be unfinished). Right now I'm working on a small mobile meteorology app for android, made with jetpack compose in collaboration with [Redux](https://github.com/ReduxFlakes) (he basically made the entire [API](https://open-meteo.com/) service and view model. Thanks mate).
My UI Designs are a 50/50, either half terrible or completely terrible.

### In the works
- Nuage, Meteorology App;
- Last Rose of Summer (a site made as a school project, featuring some HTML functions and thingies. At first I thought I would only use it for school, but it turned out surprisingly good, so I'll keep it as a personal project);
- Personal Website (work in progress).

### Learning
- Driving License
- Photography
- UI/UX design
- self-taught guitarist (despite being terrible at it). 


### Contact
You can check out my personal Instagram profile. Not really professional since this is more of a personal account (both github and the instagram). 

### Other Things
I'm reallly lazy so basically everything I do won't be finished or rushed towards the end. I'm actively trying to lose that tho.
On my freetime I like to listen to music. Can't really call myself an audiophile because that just sounds strange to me. I'm into rock and heavy metal classics, despite listening to a lot of other stuff.
